            <br>
            <div class="css-1vns4tz">

                    <h2 id="why-have-a-code-of-conduct" class="heading"><a href="#why-have-a-code-of-conduct">Why have a
                            Code of Conduct?</a></h2>
                    <p>Hack Club's community includes people from many different backgrounds. The Hack Club contributors are
                        committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age,
                        disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.</p>
                    <p>The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people
                        with different social values and communication styles can communicate effectively, productively, and
                        respectfully.</p>
                    <p>The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.
                    </p>
                    <p>The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different
                        backgrounds. Diversity is critical in order for us to build a thriving community; for Hack Club to
                        be successful, it needs hackers from all backgrounds.</p>
                    <p>With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The Code of Conduct is
                        not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they disagree.</p>

                            href="#where-does-the-code-of-conduct-apply">Where does the Code of Conduct apply?</a></h2>
                    <p>If you join in or contribute to the Hack Club ecosystem in any way, you are encouraged to follow the
                        Code of Conduct while doing so.</p>
                    <p>Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to all official online Hack Club groups,
                        in-person meetings, and events including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a href="https://github.com/HackclubVIT" class="external">GitHub projects</a></li>

                        <li>Club Meetings</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Other Hack Club groups (such as hackathons, conferences, meetups, and other unofficial forums) are
                        encouraged to adopt this Code of Conduct. Those groups must provide their own moderators and/or
                        working group (see below).</p>
                    <h2 id="hacker-values" class="heading"><a href="#hacker-values">Hacker Values</a></h2>
                    <p>These are the values to which people in the Hack Club community should aspire.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be friendly and welcoming</li>
                        <li>Be patient<ul>
                                <li>Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using
                                    their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Be thoughtful<ul>
                                <li>Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be
                                    interpreted.</li>
                                <li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Be respectful<ul>
                                <li>In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Be charitable<ul>
                                <li>Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.</li>
                                <li>When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Avoid destructive behavior:<ul>
                                <li>Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new
                                    conversation.</li>
                                <li>Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at
                                    least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.</li>
                                <li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)</li>
                                <li>Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to
                                    unnecessary conflict.</li>
                                <li>Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental
                                    indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a
                                    person or group.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this
                        inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no
                        offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do
                        not rise to it. It is the responsibility of <em>all parties</em> to de-escalate conflict when it
                        arises.</p>

                    <p>Please understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be
                        tolerated. When you participate in <a href="#where-does-the-code-of-conduct-apply" class="internal">areas
                            where the code of conduct applies</a>, you should act in the spirit of
                        the "Hacker values". If you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the Code of
                        Conduct, you will be warned and asked to stop, and your messages may be removed by community
                        moderators. Repeated offenses may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the community.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On your first offense, you will receive a written notice from one of our community moderators.
                            Depending on the degree of the reported behavior, you may be asked to apologize, either in
                            public or directly to the party that you have offended.</li>
                        <li>On a second offense, you will be temporarily removed from the community. The period of the
                            temporary ban may vary from 3 days to a month, decided based on the seriousness of the reported
                            behavior. Please note that this ban <strong>does not indicate that you are no longer welcomed in
                                the community</strong> - it represents an official warning for your behavior.</li>
                        <li>On a third offense, you may be asked to leave the community. Your account may be suspended for
                            an indefinite amount of time, and you may be publicly identified.</li>
                    </ul>

                        we deem appropriate, including immediate removal from the community. Being banned from the Hack Club
                        community may also prevent you from participating in our community events, including but not

                    <p>If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to the Working Group using the process
                        described below. <strong>Do not</strong> post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment
                        against a particular individual or group.</p>

                                    the group as a whole. That member will then raise the issue with the Working Group as a
                                    whole, preserving the privacy of the reporter (if desired).</li>
                                <li>If your report concerns a member of the Working Group they will be recused from Working
                                    Group discussions of the report.</li>
                                <li>The Working Group will strive to handle reports with discretion and sensitivity, to

                                <li>The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:<ul>

                                        <li>A request for a private or public apology.</li>

                        through polite discussion and mutual agreement. Bannings and other forceful measures are to be
